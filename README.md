# mySqlLearning

This repo is my SQL code from Colt Steele's MySQL Course containing many MySQL Database Queries.

## Installation

Just clone my repo and navigate into one of the folders to view my respective section code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/mySqlLearning.git
```

## Usage

I used DataGrip from NetBeans so I did not push my code directly to git. I copy pasted the code from the ide and saved it as a sql file and then pushed it so you'll have to go into the code and copy paste the queries yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/mySqlLearning.git
cd randomDirectory
```

## What I Learnt

I got a basic understanding of CRUD and relationships in this course so that I could implement this database using Node in a future app. I have listed the details of my roadmap below

Creating databases/tables -> CRUD -> String Functions -> Selections -> Aggregate Commands -> Logical Operators -> One to Many -> Many to Many -> Simple Web App with Node.js
